If the download link dosnt work, please bear in mind that there is no hosting service available to me right now. Moreover, due to purchasing limitation, I cannot buy or maintain a hosting server. Please send an email: abdkhan@163.com and propose how this dataset can be shared.

'Will add details by mid of March' meanwhile you can follow the steps given in https://github.com/abdkhanstd/Sports2
